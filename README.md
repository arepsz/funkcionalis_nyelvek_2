ELTE-IK functional languages 2 subject materials

All tasks are in Erlang.
To be honest I don't even know what these were about. There are some basic tasks, for example fibonacci or other recursion based functions.

### Sequential coding
The XOR task was about sequential programming in erlang.
It's basically XOR coding texts, helper functsions, decryption, encryption, etc.

### Parallel coding
The parjav and cache erlang files are about parallel programming. One is a fibonacci variation where it caches the already calculated values.
The other is a parallel any function, which starts as many processesses as there are items in the given array.

### Distributed coding
The warehouse and taskfarm tasks were about distributed programming, although the taskfarm was not finished.
In the warehouse task, a drug cartel is simulated. The bad guys arrive, the guards spot them and catch them, or they get away, etc.
